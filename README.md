# Prediction-on-Churn-Model
Predicting if Customer will stay or leave based a particular based on the csv file of churn model using Artificial Neural Networks and hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.

The architecture is relatively simple with an input layer, two hidden layers and an output layer.

The tuning of the parameters increased the accuracy from 82% to 86%
